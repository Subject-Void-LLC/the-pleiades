# net.catalyst.tag_facts

Gathers the tags defined on a Cisco Catalyst Center, as facts.

Reads every tag the targeted Catalyst Center knows about, and separates the controller's own system tags (its internal bookkeeping) from operator-created ones, so a runbook grouping devices by operator intent does not have to filter system tags out itself.

## Attributes

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Capabilities | `CatalystAPICapable` |
| Transports | `https` |
| Requires elevation | no |
| Runs | in the host process (the CLI or a Runner); acts on its target device |
| Check mode | Supported: reports what it would change and changes nothing |
| Engine version | `>=0.2.0` |

## Parameters

| Name | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `insecure_skip_verify` | `bool` | no | `false` | Skip TLS certificate verification for this call. For a lab or sandbox controller with a self-signed certificate only; never set true against a production controller. |

## Returns

| Name | Type | Returned | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tags` | `list of map` | always | One entry per tag: id, name, system_tag. |
| `operator_tags` | `list of string` | always | Names of every tag not created by the controller itself. |

## Undoing this

**Cannot be undone.** This method never records a reversing instruction, so a rollback reaching a task that used it stops rather than guessing.

A read-only fact gatherer changes nothing on the device, so there is nothing to undo.

`pleiades rollback` and the Controller's rollback route replay a recorded instruction. It is recorded during the forward run because the values an undo needs are gone once the change is applied.

## Facts it keeps

A real run stores each of these as the device's fact. A **stable** fact keeps every value it has had, and a change is drift; a **volatile** one keeps only its latest value and never counts as drift. A check stores none.

| Fact | Kind | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tags` | stable | list | One entry per tag: id, name, system_tag. |
| `operator_tags` | stable | list | Names of every tag not created by the controller itself. |

## Examples

Gather operator-created tags:

```yaml
- name: Gather Catalyst Center tag facts
  net.catalyst.tag_facts:
  register: tags
```
