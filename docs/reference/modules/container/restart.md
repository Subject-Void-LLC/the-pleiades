# container.restart

Restarts a container.

Restarts the container named name, running or stopped: SIGTERM, SIGKILL after timeout seconds, then a start. A paused or dead one is refused. With id, a container that no longer has that ID is refused. A restart has no undo. A check restarts nothing. Once the change is made, a failed read of the container afterwards is a warning, not a failure, so the task keeps its undo. The engine is reached the first way onboarding proved for the device (this machine's socket, an SSH channel to the engine's socket, the engine's own dial-stdio over SSH, or mutual TLS), its identity checked against the one onboarding recorded, and every request outside the operations this method declares is refused before it reaches the engine.

## Attributes

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Capabilities | `ContainerEngineCapable` |
| Transports | `engine_local`, `engine_socket`, `engine_stdio`, `engine_tls` |
| Requires elevation | no |
| Runs | on or against the target device; acts on its target device |
| Check mode | Supported: reports what it would change and changes nothing |
| Engine version | `>=0.2.0` |

## Parameters

| Name | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `engine` | `string` | no | - | Which container engine to use on a device that runs more than one. Needed only there: on a device with one engine, that engine is used. An engine the device does not run is refused. **Choices:** `docker`, `podman`. |
| `name` | `string` | yes | - | The container's name. |
| `id` | `string` | no | - | The container's ID, which the container named must still have: an undo recorded against one container never acts on another that took its name since. |
| `timeout` | `int` | no | `10` | Seconds the container's process has to stop after SIGTERM before it is killed, up to 3600. |
| `insecure_skip_host_key_verify` | `bool` | no | `false` | Skip SSH host key verification for this task, when the engine is reached over SSH. This removes protection against a machine in the middle answering for the device, so set it only for a target you have decided does not need it. |

## Returns

| Name | Type | Returned | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | `string` | always | The container's name. |
| `id` | `string` | when the container exists | The container's ID. |
| `state` | `string` | when the container exists or would | The container's state as the engine names it (created, running, exited, paused), after the task. |
| `warnings` | `list of string` | when there is one | What the run must say once the change was made: that the container could not be read back afterwards, or that a stopped container removed itself, so its stop has no undo. |

## Undoing this

**Cannot be undone.** This method never records a reversing instruction, so a rollback reaching a task that used it stops rather than guessing.

A restart has no undo: the container runs before and after it, and the processes it ended cannot be brought back.

`pleiades rollback` and the Controller's rollback route replay a recorded instruction. It is recorded during the forward run because the values an undo needs are gone once the change is applied.

Restart after a configuration change:

- name: Restart web
  container.restart:
    name: web
```
