// This file holds the Network devices section of docs/hephaestus.md's
// catalog: ansible.netcommon.cli_command/cli_config/netconf_config, and
// the three vendor-specific config modules (cisco.ios, junipernetworks.junos,
// arista.eos). RequiresElevation does not map cleanly onto a network OS's
// own enable-mode privilege model, so every entry here leaves it false
// rather than asserting a Linux-specific semantic onto network gear.
